# Well architecteded Framework

- Helps you build operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems
It has six pillars:
- Operational excellence - 
    - The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
    - Key topics:
        - Monitoring
        - Incident response
        - Change management
        - Operations as code
        - Evolving procedures over time
        - Learning and improving
- Security -
    - The ability to protect data, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
    - Key topics:
        - Identity and access management
        - Detective controls
        - Infrastructure protection
        - Data protection
        - Incident response
- Reliability -
    - The ability of a system to recover from failures and meet customer demand.
    - Key topics:
        - Foundations
        - Workload architecture
        - Change management
        - Failure management
- Performance efficiency -
    - The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
    - Key topics:
        - Selection
        - Review
        - Monitoring
        - Tradeoffs
- Cost optimization -
    - The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
    - Key topics:
        - Expenditure
        - Cost-effective resources
        - Matching supply and demand
        - Optimizing over time
- Sustainability -
    - The ability to minimize the negative impact on the environment while delivering business value.
    - Key topics:
        - Energy efficiency
        - Sustainable resource use
        - Emissions impact
        - Circular economy
        - Environmental impact


## Definitions

- Component - 
    - A component is a part of a system that has a specific function and can be replaced or modified without affecting the rest of the system. It is the code, configuration, and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other component
- Workload - A set of components that together deliver business value. A workload is a collection of components that work together to deliver a specific function or service. It is the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other workloads.
- System/Architecture - A system is a collection of components that work together to deliver a specific function or service. It is the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other systems. An architecture is a high-level view of a system, showing how the components work together to deliver the function or service.
- Milestone - A milestone is a specific point in time that marks the completion of a significant phase or event in a project. It is a key point in the project timeline that indicates progress and helps to track the project's overall status.
- Technology Portfolio - 
    - A technology portfolio is a collection of workloads that are grouped together based on a common technology or platform.

    ## General Design Principles
    - Stop guessing your capacity needs
    - Test systems at production scale
    - Automate to make architectural experimentation easier -Automation allows you to create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.
    - Allow for evolutionary architectures
    - Drive architectural improvements through data
    - Improve through game days
